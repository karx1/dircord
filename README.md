# dIRCord

A very simple Discord-IRC bridge written in Rust. Still very much work-in-progress.

TODO:
- [] handle join and leave messages
- [] use the tracing crate
- [] `irc` crate config toml
- [] handle attachments properly
- [] don't ping IRC users (and color IRC usernames)
- [] handle discord pings
