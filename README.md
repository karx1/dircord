# dIRCord

A very simple Discord-IRC bridge written in Rust. Still very much work-in-progress.

TODO:
- [x] handle join and leave messages
- [ ] use the tracing crate
- [x] `irc` crate config toml
- [x] handle attachments properly
- [x] don't ping IRC users (and color IRC usernames)
- [ ] handle discord pings
